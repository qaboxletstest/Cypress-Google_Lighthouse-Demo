cypress-audit example project

This is an example repository to showcase how you can use cypress-audit to easily integrate lighthouse commands into your Cypress tests.

Cypress - Functional Automation testing tool
Lighthouse - Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and best-practices.

You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, from a web UI (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

Out of these five categories (performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and best-practices), performance is the most important one.
